## What is Jocker and What is Docker?

Jocker is the simple implementation of docker that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.

The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.
